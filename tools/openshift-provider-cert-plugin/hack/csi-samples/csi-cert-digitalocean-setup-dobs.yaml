  # The range of disk size supported by this driver. Note that Min must be the EXACT size of a volume
  # that can be provisioned by the CSI driver. For example, when the driver requires volume sizes to be
  # rounded to a certain value (typically 1 or 4 GiB), Min must be rounded to that value. A test will
  # check that when it asks for a volume with size Min, it will get the volume with exactly that size.

  # Map of strings for supported mount options. This will be used to test that the CSI driver correctly
  # passes a mount option from Kubernetes to the kernel mount table. The mount options listed here must be:
  # 1. Supported by both the CSI driver and the kernel.
  # 2. Non-default. Note that the real set of all default mount options depends on the kernel and filesystem type.
  # 3. Visible in /proc/mounts after mount.
  # 4. Harmless, i.e., the mount option should not affect how the storage behaves too much.
